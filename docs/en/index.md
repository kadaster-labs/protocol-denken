**Protocol thinking** is our own term. It is a future vision and
perspective based on the history and evolution of technology, internet and the digital
era. When we look at this [evolution from paper to digital](./papier-naar-digitaal.md) and
try to project today's development, we can recognize a number of things that will
shape the development of the future.

We recognize developments that resemble the emergence of the internet and the web. At that time
internet protocols were developed that were designed to be 'very thin', while today's protocols
are 'thick protocols'. We are taking steps to further implement [automation](./automatisering.md)
in our processes. Data is increasingly central and the origin and [emergence of
data](./ontstaan-van-data.md) becomes increasingly important and thus also the [language and
semantics](./taal-en-semantiek.md).

The exchange of data is part of the digital society. This goes beyond connecting
computers to the emergence of the internet and builds on it. But with more extensive
conditions and stricter execution of the rules under which data is created and exchanged. A
thick protocol therefore. And since data exchange always takes place between multiple parties (otherwise
it is not data exchange :grin:) developing these protocols together is a prerequisite.
Moreover, to have confidence in the data exchange and the data itself (incl. the origin,
provenance, etc) it is necessary that these protocols are also open, just as the internet
protocols are open. Open Source and Open Standards are the way of working for the
emergence and development of these protocols.

A number of **[solutions](./oplossingen.md)** are emerging. This gives suggestions for a
**[dream vision](./oplossingen.md#droombeeld)** in which **[event-driven
registers](./oplossingen.md#gebeurtenisgedreven-registers)** in **[open
collaboration](./oplossingen.md#open-samenwerken)** in a **[network of
data streams](./oplossingen.md#netwerken--datastromen)** are designed and exist. This is **protocol
thinking** in short.
